# User Guide

Welcome to the Wilsons-Raiders User Guide. This document provides in-depth information on how to effectively use, configure, and operate the Wilsons-Raiders system.

## 1. Introduction to Wilsons-Raiders

Wilsons-Raiders is an advanced, autonomous cybersecurity platform designed to automate and orchestrate various security operations, from reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning to exploit validation and reporting. It leverages AI agents and a sophisticated workflow engine to provide comprehensive security assessments.

## 2. Key Concepts

To get the most out of Wilsons-Raiders, it's helpful to understand its core concepts:

*   **Agents**: AI-powered modules that perform specific tasks (e.g., Red Team Agent, Reconnaissance Agent).
*   **Workflows**: Automated sequences of tasks and agent interactions designed to achieve a specific security objective (e.g., a full penetration test, a compliance audit).
*   **Chains**: Linked sequences of exploits or attacks that can be automatically executed by the system.
*   **Policies**: Rules that govern the behavior of agents, define operational security (OPSEC), and enforce rate limits and validation strategies.
*   **Validation Profiles**: Predefined sets of validation tactics (e.g., safe, normal, aggressive) used to confirm findings.
