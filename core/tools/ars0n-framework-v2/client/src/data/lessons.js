Phase 1 focuses on host discovery - identifying which IP addresses in the network ranges are actually alive and responding. Phase 2 focuses on service enumeration - determining which live hosts are running web services.",
          "This two-phase approach is much more efficient than trying to scan all possible web ports on all possible IP addresses. By first identifying live hosts, we can focus our more intensive service scanning on targets that are actually responsive.",
          "Phase 1 uses TCP connect probes on common service ports (80, 443, 22, 21, 25, 53, etc.) to quickly determine host liveness. If any port responds, the host is marked as live. Phase 2 then performs detailed scanning of web-specific ports only on the live hosts.",
